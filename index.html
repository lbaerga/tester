        <p>Marc Anthony is a famous Salsa singer. He holds the Guinness World Record for best-selling tropical/salsa artist and the most number-one albums on the Billboard Tropical Albums year-end charts.[
        <p>Marc Anthony's given name is Marco Antonio Muñiz. He was born in New York City to parents who came from Puerto Rico. His mother Guillermina was a housewife. His father, Felipe Muñiz, was a hospital cafeteria worker and musician.
        <p>Marc Anthony got his start by singing backup for other musicians. At first, Marc Anthony wasn't interested in performing Salsa. In fact, his first album wasn't even Salsa, it was Freestyle! He was inspired to try after hearing a song in a taxi that he thought would sound good performed in the style of salsa music.

      Tips
        <!-- Problem 6 -->
      
        <li>Add some cooked/mashed sweet potato. It won't change the taste, but it'll add some good low-glycemic carbs.</li>
        <li>Make your own stock! It's much healthier/cheaper.</li>
        <li>Use pre-crushed garlic. It saves a lot of time on prep.</li>
